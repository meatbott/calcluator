# Calculator Project

## The Odin Project: Calculator Project

I am getting this project started after quite a delay since last project made any progress.

I had to relearn the git commands in git bash just to get it cloned, and then I first spelled the repo "calcluator". Ugh...

So anyway, this is supposed to be a basic, functioning calculator. Time will tell if it becomes what it is supposed to be or if it stalls at some point.

A quick glance at other peoples' calculator projects reveals that it must account for edge cases such as starting a number with "0" or pressing "=" without any numbers in the display. I have a rough idea of the *business* logic I will have to implement.

Creating this repo is a good start. From here I should make improvements and build the thing, ideally daily.

## Use:

Anyone that can use a computer can use a calculator so, yeah, use it like that. Of course the built-in calculator on any given computing device will be much better and work as expected but this is a good *programming* exercise, or at least it sounds like a good one hypothetically.

## Dependencies:

This is a JavaScript exercise so it must be enabled to do anything with this project.

Literal Dependencies:

- Web Browser (I recommend Fire Fox)
- JavaScript
- Monitor (I fear I lack the capacity to create a calculator that supports screen readers at this time)
- Desire to use an inferior app
- Mostly curiosity
- Basic understanding of English and mathematics or willingness to try either
